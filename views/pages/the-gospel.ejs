            It is not by chance that you have visited our site today. Although we have not had time to become acquainted, I would like to share with you something most wonderful. Some time ago I met a remarkable Person, so great and outstanding that it has become a great joy just to introduce Him to others. The great tragedy is that so many know about Him, but so few know Him personally. Perhaps you have already surmised that I am speaking of Jesus Christ.
            
            <br><br>To some He is little more than a word of blasphemy, to others a source of embarrassment, but to those who know Him, He is wonderful!

            <br><br>The New Testament, in the book of Acts, records how a man named Paul persecuted the early Christians. But after he met Jesus, his life was transformed. He wrote, "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief." (I Timothy 1:15)

            <br><br>It hurts our pride to have to admit that we are sinners, but it is wonderful when we experience the power of Jesus Christ to forgive our sins and heal our hearts. When once we accept Him as our Saviour, we make an amazing discovery. Jesus did not come to make us stuffy saints or miserable mortals, but He came to give us LIFE -- the very fullest and richest. Listen to Jesus' own words:

            <br><br>"I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly." (John 10:10)

            <br><br>Dear Reader, whatever may have been your disappointment with people, disillusionment with life, and confusion with religion, let me assure you that this is not the fault of Jesus Christ. He has been misrepresented, betrayed, denied, and neglected, but He continues to stand majestically, in love pleading with every one of earth's billions,

            <br><br>"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." (Matthew 11:28)

            <br><br>Do you personally know the Lord Jesus Christ? Repent of your sins, believe that Jesus died on the cross to pay for your sins. Receive him as your personal Saviour through faith, and learn to make him the Lord of your life. Read the following scripture carefully.

            <br><br>"If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be SAVED." (Romans 10:9)

            <br><br>If you want to know more about this wonderful Saviour, all you have to do is read the John/Romans located on the home page of this site. Talk to a committed Christian or visit our church were Pastor Desent will explain to you the good news of salvation. All things are planned by God -- even your visit to this site. Do not harden yourself against His call. Pray that the Holy Spirit will open your mind and heart to let Jesus in. Salvation will be going from death to life. Jesus said,

            <br><br>"He that heareth my word, and believeth on Him that sent me hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life." (John 5:24)

            <br><br> This is the greatest mission of HBC.
